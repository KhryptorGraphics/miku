# Run demo

We have an alpha demo available for you to try out. You can chat with the test bot and see how it works. [Click here](https://alpha.miku.gg) to go to the alpha demo.
The demo bot is a OpenAI-compatible bot. You will have to provide your OpenAI's API key to use it.

!!!warning Only for testing
The demo is only intended for testing purposes. The recommended way to run your own bot is to download the source code and run it locally.
